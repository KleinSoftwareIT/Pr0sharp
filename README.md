# Pr0sharp - C# pr0gramm.com API library
Pr0sharp (alternative title Pr0#) is an implementation of the API provided by the german imageboard [pr0gramm.com](https://pr0gramm.com) written purely in C#.
The library was born due to being necessary for the still ongoing project keyb0x.pro to handle auth and other functionality.

Licensed under MIT, the librarys goal is to allow quick and comfortable access to all API endpoints.

**NOTICE:** The library is still under construction, there are many things that aren't implemented yet while the current implementation might not be ideal.

# How to use

For the time being, to use the library you either need to compile it from source and grab the dll file or reference the csproj directly in your project.
It is planned to provide easier access to the library via Github releases and/or Nuget in the future

After somehow getting the library referenced in your project, these are the next steps:

# How to build

Building the library is super simple. All you need is `Visual Studio 2022` or any other C#-capable IDE like `JetBrains Rider`.
Simply open the solution file and hit `Build Project`.
Alternatively you can build the library on the command line via `dotnet build`.
In both cases the resulting binary will be placed in the respective subfolder of `/bin`
